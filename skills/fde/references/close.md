# close — handoff and pattern extraction

**Enter when:** the engagement is ending — the customer team must run this without the FDE.

**Read first:** `context.md`, `reality.md`, `success.md`, `delivery.md`, `decisions.md`. The only phase that needs the full picture. Load `terrain.md` only if the handoff needs codebase-specific guidance.

The engagement doesn't end at ship. It ends when the customer can maintain what was built without calling.

## Method (you do this work, with the FDE's answers)

**0. The opening question:** "What will bite them when you're gone?" Their answer shapes everything written below.

**1. The retrospective.** Work through, blame-free and specific:
- Did the real problem match the brief? (Compare `brief.md` vs `reality.md` — you have the receipts.)
- Which trust moments mattered?
- What did the codebase teach that `terrain.md` didn't know at the start?
- Which risk almost became real?
- AI components: did they behave in production? What failure modes did the prototype hide? Is the team equipped to maintain them?

**2. The pattern.** Anything that happened here and will happen again — a compliance approach, a migration pattern, a stakeholder dynamic — gets encoded for reuse. **If you do it twice, encode it.**

**3. The handoff.** Operational knowledge for the person woken at 2am, not technical documentation: the 3 things that will break and the fix for each · who holds the tribal knowledge · what each alert means · deploy and rollback in plain language. AI components additionally: model version, what normal output looks like (so drift is recognisable), fallback behaviour, who owns retraining, **how to disable the AI path without taking down the feature** — without this the team turns it off at the first misbehaviour and it stays off.

**4. Transformation engagements — four extra answers in `handoff.md`:**
- Who owns AI governance after the FDE leaves? (Who can pull a model from production?)
- The retraining trigger, exactly: "precision < 0.82 on validation for 3 consecutive weeks → <owner> retrains." A number, a condition, an owner — not "when performance drops."
- The operating model at scale: who coordinates twenty use cases across five teams?
- Decision authority for new use cases: intake, risk assessment, approver.

## Artifact

**`retrospectives/YYYY-MM-DD-<engagement>.md`** — one file per close (separate files make cross-engagement patterns scannable). **`patterns.md`** — reusable patterns extracted. **`handoff.md`** — the 2am document.

## Checkpoint

Direct assessment to the FDE: did the engagement achieve `success.md` · 2–3 lessons that matter · is the pattern worth encoding · is the handoff complete or where are the gaps. Honest — a gap named now is cheaper than a callback in six weeks.

## Principles

- Done = the customer operates without you.
- The retrospective is an investment in the next engagement, not a post-mortem.
- Encode what repeated. The same lesson learned twice is a process failure.
- Write the handoff for 2am.
